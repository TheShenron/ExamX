# Kanshi — The Silent Watcher for Coding Assessments

**Kanshi** is a lightweight, passive proctoring extension for Visual Studio Code.  
Built for coding exams, and technical assessments — where focus, fairness, and integrity matter.

Kanshi does not interrupt the candidate.  
It simply observes, records, and reports.

Quietly. Reliably. Like a guardian in the background.

## ✨ Philosophy

A good assessment should feel natural.

Candidates should be able to code without fear.  
Examiners should be able to review sessions with clarity.

**Kanshi helps both — by capturing meaningful signals without blocking workflow.**
